## Overview

The Mytoken smart contract is a basic Ethereum-based token contract written in Solidity. It allows you to create tokens (mint) and destroy them (burn) for a specific address. This contract can serve as a foundation for more complex token systems or as a learning resource for Solidity developers.

## Contract Details

- **Name**: Mytoken
- **Symbol/Abbreviation**: Nga
- **Decimals**: 18
- **Total Supply**: Initially 0, increases with minting

## Functions

### Mint

The `mint` function allows users to create new tokens and increase the balance of a specified address.

```solidity
function mint(address _address, uint value) public
```

- `_address`: The Ethereum address to receive the new tokens.
- `value`: The amount of tokens to create and send to `_address`.

### Burn

The `burn` function allows users to destroy (burn) tokens held by a specific address.

```solidity
function burn(address _address, uint value) public
```

- `_address`: The Ethereum address from which to burn tokens.
- `value`: The amount of tokens to burn from `_address`.

## Getting Started

To use this contract:

1. Deploy it to an Ethereum-compatible blockchain.
2. Interact with it by calling the `mint` and `burn` functions to create and destroy tokens.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the contract:

1. Deploy the contract to an Ethereum network.
2. Mint tokens to specific addresses.
3. Burn tokens from addresses when needed.
